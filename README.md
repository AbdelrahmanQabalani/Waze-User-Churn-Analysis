# Waze User Churn Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Waze user behavior data to support building a machine learning model that predicts user churn.

## Business Problem
Waze wants to identify users who are likely to stop using the app so the ⟪entity⟫["organization","Waze","navigation app company us"]⟫ can improve retention strategies.

## My Role
I explored user activity features such as sessions, drives, activity days, and distance driven to understand patterns linked to churn.

## Key Analysis Steps
- Reviewed dataset structure and data types
- Checked missing values and anomalies
- Compared behavior of churned vs retained users
- Identified potential predictive features

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Exploratory Data Inspection

## Next Steps
Clean data, handle outliers, select key features, and build a churn prediction model.
